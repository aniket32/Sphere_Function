# Sphere_Function
This code is a sample code provided by the Lecturer for a Sphere Function to demontrate the firness function and getting us started to use natural computing.
This also includes the constraints required
The main objective of the program is to print out all 50 solutions, their evaluated sample solutions and the best fitnes value
The fitness value of the Sphere Function is 0, the lower the evaluated value is closed to 0 the better the solutons
